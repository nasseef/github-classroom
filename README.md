### Creating an Assignment on GitHub Classroom

1. Go to [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com)
2. If you would like to distribute starter code, create a template repository with your starter code and modify the `Setting` by checking `Template repository`.
3. Add appropriate `Actions` or `Travis-CI` files for testing.
4. When you create a new assignment, you can point to this template as your starter code.
   

> I recommend using private repositories and making sure the students don't have admin access to them.
